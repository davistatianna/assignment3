    <p>Greetings to the one reading this! My name is Tatianna Davis. 
        I was born in Florida and raised in North Carolina with my sister and mother. 
        I transferred to NCAT during my sophomore year from Howard University, and I am 
        scheduled to graduate in December 2026. I'm currently deciding whether I want to
         pursue graduate school right after or go straight into a PhD program. 
         Doctor Davis has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? Thanks for reading, bye for neow!
